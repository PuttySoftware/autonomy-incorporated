# Autonomy Incorporated
A role-playing game illustrating the perils of taking autonomy to its logical conclusion: A mega-corporation somewhere had the bright idea of replacing absolutely every human with a robot. It took 145 years after efforts were started in 2005, implying that it's the year 2150, and that the efforts were successful... of course, nothing like this ever goes according to plan, right? The robots have now become a hazard to the community they were supposed to serve, and this is where you come in, to fix this mess.
