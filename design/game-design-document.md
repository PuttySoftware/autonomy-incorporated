# Autonomy Incorporated

*Game design document.*

# Game Identity:

A role-playing game illustrating the perils of taking autonomy to its logical conclusion.

# Design Pillars:

*Slow-paced. Story-driven. Futuristic.*

# Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary:

A mega-corporation somewhere had the bright idea of replacing absolutely every human with a robot. It took 145 years after efforts were started in 2005, implying that it's the year 2150, and that the efforts were successful... of course, nothing like this ever goes according to plan, right? The robots have now become a hazard to the community they were supposed to serve, and this is where you come in, to fix this mess. Implemented as a 2D, top-down, dungeon
crawling RPG, with buildings in the corporate headquarters standing in for traditional dungeons.

# Features:

Each of the buildings comprising the game\'s levels has a theme. The first of these serves as a tutorial of sorts - though you can lose, it\'s harder to do so here than in later levels. Each level builds upon any preceding it, by adding new objects to what you already know about, in its theme. The big exception to this pattern is the final level, which combines all the elements seen previously with many more things introduced for the first time. Each level is guarded by a boss, representing progressively higher management levels in the organization chart for the company gone bad.

# Interface:

Players provide input through multiple methods (keyboard, joystick, touch) with the game not requiring players to stick to one method for any period at all. If a given input method isn\'t supported, it is simply excluded from consideration. The game UI largely gets out of the way until it is needed: it is desirable, but not required, for there to be few to no on-screen virtual buttons for touch devices that are always present, for example.

# Art Style:

Neo-Retro art style (retro-inspired graphics, updated for the modern era).
Need list of games using this style.

# Music/Sound:

Music and sound style both follow the art direction.
Need game list.

# Development Roadmap / Launch Criteria:

**Platform:** Mac App Store, Windows, Linux, iOS. Maybe also Google Play.

**Audience:** Role-players of any disposition.

Development plan goes here.
